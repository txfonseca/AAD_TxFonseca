1. Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Install the Azure Active Directory PowerShell module by running the following command:
```powershell
Install-Module AzureAD
```
3. Import the Azure Active Directory PowerShell module by running the following command:
```powershell
Import-Module AzureAD

 

```powershell
# Update extension attribute for a list of users in Azure AD

 

# Set variables
$extensionAttributeName = "extensionAttribute1"
$extensionAttributeValue = "New Value"
$users = Import-Csv -Path "C:\Path\To\Users.csv"

 

# Connect to Azure AD
Connect-AzureAD

 

# Loop through each user and update the extension attribute
foreach ($user in $users) {
    $userId = $user.Id
    try {
        Set-AzureADUserExtension -ObjectId $userId -ExtensionName $extensionAttributeName -ExtensionValue $extensionAttributeValue
        Write-Host "Extension attribute updated for user with ID: $userId"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error updating extension attribute for user with ID: $userId"
        Write-Host $_.Exception.Message
    }
}

 

# Disconnect from Azure AD
Disconnect-AzureAD
```

 

Make sure to update the following variables before running the script:
- `$extensionAttributeName`: The name of the extension attribute you want to update.
- `$extensionAttributeValue`: The value you want to set for the extension attribute.
- `$users`: The path to the CSV file containing the list of users you want to update. Make sure the CSV file has a header row with the column name "Id" and a list of user IDs in the subsequent rows.

 

The script will loop through each user in the CSV file and attempt to update the extension attribute. If the update is successful, it will output a message saying so. If it fails, it will output a message with the error details.
