# Step 1: Define your tenant ID, client ID, and client secret
# These values are used to authenticate your application with Azure AD.
$tenantId = "<your-tenant-id>"
$clientId = "<your-client-id>"
$clientSecret = "<your-client-secret>"

# Step 2: Define the token endpoint
# This is the URL where you will send the authentication request to obtain an access token.
$tokenEndpoint = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token"

# Step 3: Define the body for the token request
# The body contains the necessary parameters for the token request, including the client ID, scope, client secret, and grant type.
$body = @{
    client_id     = $clientId
    scope         = "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
    client_secret = $clientSecret
    grant_type    = "client_credentials"
}

# Step 4: Make the token request
# Use the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet to send a POST request to the token endpoint with the specified body.
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $tokenEndpoint -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -Body $body

# Step 5: Extract the access token
# The response from the token endpoint will include an access token, which you can extract and use for subsequent API requests.
$accessToken = $response.access_token
Write-Output "Access Token: $accessToken"
